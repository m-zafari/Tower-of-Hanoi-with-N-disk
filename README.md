This code provides an implementation of the Tower of Hanoi with N disks using a recursive function.
As an example:
Enter the number of Disk:4
Move Disk number 1: A to B
Move Disk number 2: A to C
Move Disk number 1: B to C
Move Disk number 3: A to B
Move Disk number 1: C to A
Move Disk number 2: C to B
Move Disk number 1: A to B
Move Disk number 4: A to C
Move Disk number 1: B to C
Move Disk number 2: B to A
Move Disk number 1: C to A
Move Disk number 3: B to C
Move Disk number 1: A to B
Move Disk number 2: A to C
Move Disk number 1: B to C
THE NUMBER OF MOVES : 15
